                                            <p>Before starting the analysis, the collected data must be prepared. One of
                                                the stages of preparation is data cleaning using special algorithms,
                                                techniques and tools.</p>

                                            <p>Remember, the overall goal of data cleaning is to increase the data’s
                                                integrity (i.e., its reliability, accuracy and consistency).</p>

                                            <p>Before gathering or analyzing any data, you first need to determine
                                                whether a relationship exists between two variables; say, blood pressure
                                                and a new drug, “drug x.”</p>
                                            <div class="in_list">
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <p><strong>Data duplication.</strong> The same object appears in
                                                            the table twice. For example, it comes from two different
                                                            sources or was duplicated due to an erroneous write
                                                            operation. This breaks the statistic as it doubles the value
                                                            that should be single.</p>

                                                    <li>
                                                        <p><strong>Non-unique values.</strong> Sometimes a unique
                                                            parameter must correspond to a particular entry. For
                                                            example, two different people cannot have the same insurance
                                                            policy number. If the number is the same in two records,
                                                            this is an error. As a result, the processing of such data
                                                            may fail and not complete.</p>

                                                    <li>
                                                        <p><strong>Data inconsistency.</strong> In this case, there is
                                                            only one object, there are several records about it, and the
                                                            data in these records is not the same. For example, given
                                                            different phone numbers. This error occurs when collecting
                                                            data from multiple sources and needs to be corrected -
                                                            merged or deleted. Otherwise, the algorithm will either
                                                            perceive the objects as different, or it will not be able to

                                                            wrong. For example, a Russian phone number that starts with

                                            <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyzing data</h3>
                                            <p>In data analytics, exploratory data analysis is how we describe the
                                                practice of investigating a dataset and summarizing its main features.
                                                It is a form of descriptive analytics. EDA aims to spot patterns and
                                                trends, to identify anomalies, and to test early hypotheses. Although
                                                exploratory data analysis can be carried out at various stages of the
                                                data analytics process, it is usually conducted before a firm hypothesis
                                                or end goal is defined.</p>
                                            <p>In general, EDA focuses on understanding the characteristics of a dataset
                                                before deciding what we want to do with that dataset.</p>
                                            <h3>Why is exploratory data analysis important?</h3>

                                            <p>Exploratory data analytics often uses visual techniques, such as graphs,
                                                plots, and other visualizations. This is because our natural
                                                pattern-detecting abilities make it much easier to spot trends and
                                                anomalies when they’re represented visually. As a simple example,
                                                outliers (or data points that skew a trend) stand out much more
                                                immediately on a scatter graph than they do in columns on a spreadsheet.

                                                    <p> Race cars, however, put out raw power and it is largely up to

                                                <p>There is simply no denying that Python is among the most popular
                                                    programming languages in the world and
                                                    it is so for a reason. Actually, it is considered to be a rock-solid
                                                    programming language for a variety
                                                    of reasons, including the fact that it is conducive to business
                                                    analytics. The aforementioned uses
                                                    happen because Python makes it easier for businesses to work with
                                                    big data, implement automation,

                                                <h3>What Is Hypothesis Testing?</h3>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>To understand what hypothesis testing is, it’s important first to
                                                    understand what
                                                    a hypothesis is.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>A hypothesis or hypothesis statement seeks to explain why something
                                                    has happened,
                                                    or what might happen, under certain conditions. It can also be used
                                                    to understand how
                                                    different variables relate to each other. Hypotheses are often
                                                    written as if-then statements;
                                                    for example, “If this happens, then this will happen.”</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>Hypothesis testing, then, is a statistical means of testing an
                                                    assumption stated in a hypothesis.
                                                    While the specific methodology leveraged depends on the nature of
                                                    the hypothesis and data available,
                                                    hypothesis testing typically uses sample data to extrapolate
                                                    insights about a larger population.</p>

                                                <p>When it comes to data-driven decision-making, there’s a certain
                                                    amount of risk that can mislead a professional.
                                                    This could be due to flawed thinking or observations, incomplete or
                                                    inaccurate data, or the presence of unknown
                                                    variables. The danger in this is that, if major strategic decisions
                                                    are made based on flawed insights, it can
                                                    lead to wasted resources, missed opportunities, and catastrophic
                                                    outcomes.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>The real value of hypothesis testing in business is that it allows
                                                    professionals to test their theories and assumptions
                                                    before putting them into action. This essentially allows an
                                                    organization to verify its analysis is
                                                    correct before committing resources to implement a broader strategy.
                                                </p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>As one example, consider a company that wishes to launch a new
                                                    marketing campaign to revitalize sales
                                                    during a slow period. Doing so could be an incredibly expensive
                                                    endeavor, depending on the campaign’s
                                                    size and complexity. The company, therefore, may wish to test the
                                                    campaign on a smaller scale to
                                                    understand how it will perform.</p>
                                                </br>

                                                <p>In this example, the hypothesis that’s being tested would fall along
                                                    the lines of: “If the company
                                                    launches a new marketing campaign, then it will translate into an
                                                    increase in sales.” It may
                                                    even be possible to quantify how much of a lift in sales the company
                                                    expects to see from the
                                                    effort. Pending the results of the pilot campaign, the business
                                                    would then know whether it
                                                    makes sense to roll it out more broadly.</p>

                                                <p><strong>1. Alternative Hypothesis and Null Hypothesis</strong></p>
                                                </p>In hypothesis testing, the hypothesis that’s being tested is known
                                                as the alternative hypothesis.
                                                Often, it’s expressed as a correlation or statistical relationship
                                                between variables.
                                                The null hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement that’s meant to
                                                show there’s no
                                                statistical relationship between variables being tested. It’s typically
                                                the exact opposite
                                                of whatever is stated in the alternative hypothesis.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p> For example, consider a company’s leadership team who historically
                                                    and reliably
                                                    sees $12 million in monthly revenue. They want to understand if
                                                    reducing the price
                                                    of their services will attract more customers and, in turn, increase
                                                    revenue.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>In this case, the alternative hypothesis may take the form of a
                                                    statement such as:
                                                    <em>“If we reduce the price of our flagship service by five percent,

                                                    wouldn’t increase
                                                    from the base of $12 million, or might even decrease.</p>

                                                <p>Statistically speaking, if you were to run the same scenario 100
                                                    times, you’d likely receive somewhat different
                                                    results each time. If you were to plot these results in a
                                                    distribution plot, you’d
                                                    see the most likely outcome is at the tallest point in the graph,
                                                    with less likely
                                                    outcomes falling to the right and left of that point.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <div class="image_">

                                                <p>With this in mind, imagine you’ve completed your hypothesis test and
                                                    have your results,
                                                    which indicate there may be a correlation between the variables you
                                                    were testing.
                                                    To understand your results' significance, you’ll need to identify a
                                                    p-value for the test,
                                                    which helps note how confident you are in the test results.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>In statistics, the p-value depicts the probability that, assuming the
                                                    null hypothesis is correct,
                                                    you might still observe results that are at least as extreme as the
                                                    results of your hypothesis test.
                                                    The smaller the p-value, the more likely the alternative hypothesis
                                                    is correct, and the greater the
                                                    significance of your results.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p><strong>3. One-Sided vs. Two-Sided Testing</strong></p>
                                                <p>When it’s time to test your hypothesis, it’s important to leverage
                                                    the correct testing method.
                                                    The two most common hypothesis testing methods are one-sided and
                                                    two-sided tests, or one-tailed and
                                                    two-tailed tests, respectively.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>Typically, you’d leverage a one-sided test when you have a strong
                                                    conviction about the direction
                                                    of change you expect to see due to your hypothesis test. You’d
                                                    leverage a two-sided test when you’re
                                                    less confident in the direction of change. </p>

                                                <p><strong> 4. Sampling</strong></p>
                                                <p>To perform hypothesis testing in the first place, you need to collect
                                                    a sample of data to be analyzed.
                                                    Depending on the question you’re seeking to answer or investigate,
                                                    you might collect samples through
                                                    surveys, observational studies, or experiments.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>A survey involves asking a series of questions to a random population
                                                    sample and
                                                    recording self-reported responses.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>Observational studies involve a researcher observing a sample
                                                    population and collecting
                                                    data as it occurs naturally, without intervention.</p>
                                                </br>
                                                <p>Finally, an experiment involves dividing a sample into multiple
                                                    groups, one of which acts
                                                    as the control group. For each non-control group, the variable being
                                                    studied is manipulated
                                                    to determine how the data collected differs from that of the control
                                                    group.</p>

                                                    </br>
                                                    <p>One of the cardinal rules of statistically exploring
                                                        relationships is to never assume
                                                        correlation implies causation. In other words, just because two
                                                        variables move in the
                                                        same direction doesn’t mean one caused the other to occur.</p>
                                                    <p>If two or more variables are correlated, their directional
                                                        movements are related.
                                                        If two variables are positively correlated, it means that as one
                                                        goes up or down,
                                                        so does the other. Alternatively, if two variables are
                                                        negatively correlated, one goes
                                                        up while the other goes down.</p>
                                                    <p>A correlation’s strength can be quantified by calculating the
                                                        correlation coefficient,
                                                        sometimes represented by r. The correlation coefficient falls
                                                        between negative one and positive one.</p>

                                                    <p>r = -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.</p>
                                                    <p>r = 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.</p>
                                                    <p>r = 0 indicates no correlation.</p>
                                                    <p>Causation means that one variable caused the other to occur.
                                                        Proving a causal relationship between
                                                        variables requires a true experiment with a control group (which
                                                        doesn’t receive the independent
                                                        variable) and an experimental group (which receives the

                                                        prove causation. It can be tempting to assume that one variable
                                                        caused the other—especially

                                                    <h3>What Is Regression Analysis?</h3>
                                                    </br>
                                                    <p>Regression analysis is the statistical method used to determine
                                                        the structure of a relationship between
                                                        two variables (single linear regression) or three or more
                                                        variables (multiple regression).</p>
                                                    <p>One way to think of regression is by visualizing a scatter plot
                                                        of your data with the independent
                                                        variable on the X-axis and the dependent variable on the Y-axis.
                                                        The regression line is the line
                                                        that best fits the scatter plot data. The regression equation
                                                        represents the line’s slope and the relationship between the two
                                                        variables, along with an estimation of error.</p>
                                                    <p>Physically creating this scatter plot can be a natural starting
                                                        point for parsing
                                                        out the relationships between variables.</p>

                                                    </br>
                                                    <p>There are two types of regression analysis: single variable
                                                        linear regression and multiple regression.
                                                        Single variable linear regression is used to determine the
                                                        relationship between two variables:
                                                        the independent and dependent. The equation for a single
                                                        variable linear regression looks like this:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <div class="image_">

                                                    </div>
                                                    <p>In the equation:</p>
                                                    <p>ŷ is the expected value of Y (the dependent variable) for a given
                                                        value of X (the independent variable).</p>
                                                    <p>x is the independent variable.</p>
                                                    <p>α is the Y-intercept, the point at which the regression line
                                                        intersects with the vertical axis.</p>
                                                    <p>β is the slope of the regression line, or the average change in
                                                        the dependent variable as the independent variable increases by
                                                        one.</p>
                                                    <p>ε is the error term, equal to Y – ŷ, or the difference between
                                                        the actual value of the dependent variable and its expected
                                                        value.</p>
                                                    <p>Multiple regression, on the other hand, is used to determine the
                                                        relationship between three or more variables: the dependent
                                                        variable and
                                                        at least two independent variables. The multiple regression
                                                        equation looks complex but is similar to
                                                        the single variable linear regression equation:</p>
                                                    <div class="image_">

                                                    </div>
                                                    <p>Each component of this equation represents the same thing as in
                                                        the previous equation, with the addition of the subscript k,
                                                        which is the
                                                        total number of independent variables being examined. For each
                                                        independent variable you include in the regression, multiply the
                                                        slope of
                                                        the regression line by the value of the independent variable,
                                                        and add it to the rest of the equation.</p>

                                                    <p>Once you’ve generated a regression equation for a set of

                                                        relationship between your independent and dependent variables.
                                                        If you input a specific X value
                                                        into the equation, you can see the expected Y value.</p>
                                                    <p>This can be critical for predicting the outcome of potential
                                                        changes, allowing you to ask,
                                                        “What would happen if this factor changed by a specific amount?”

                                                        could allow you to find the

                                                <p>Analytics allows you to quickly find the reasons that force users
                                                    to leave the game, identify the risk group and, based on the
                                                    information recorded in daily reports, develop strategies to
                                                    retain players. Product optimization uses mobile and social
                                                    gaming analytics applications provided by Claritics, Kontagent,
                                                    Mixpanel, Flurry, Totango and Google Analytics. However,
                                                    in addition to external systems, analysts can also use internal

                                                <p>Each specific problem needs its own set of data inside and outside

                                                    ideally, anticipating likely bottlenecks. For example, you can
                                                    establish the dependence of each traffic channel on the user's life
                                                    path, breaking this path into stages: from the beginning of
                                                    installation to full pumping and payments. A chain of custom events
                                                    not only creates a convenient funnel for each traffic provider (and
                                                    allows you to count the conversion), but also makes it possible to
                                                    determine the exact place of loss at each stage. If any stage shows
                                                    the failure of the players, we can detail it before establishing

                                                    Often the same data is processed in different systems, duplicated by
